- 👋 Hi, I’m @NathanPaceydev
- 👀 I’m interested in Theorectical Physics, Computing, Mathematics, Robotics and Mechanical Design. And on the Weekends I love to Wakeboard and play the Cello!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. I am currently studying at Queen's University studying Engineering Physics and Computing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies and people that are working on projects that will help the world one idea at a time.
- 📫 How to reach me, by email nathan.pacey@magna.com.

I would like to continue to work in the engineering field and create design that matters. So if you are intrested in talking to someone about the latest physics or are looking for an employee let me know!
