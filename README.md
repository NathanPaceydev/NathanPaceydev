Hi I am Nathan Pacey.
- I’m interested in Theoretical Physics, Computing, Mathematics, Robotics and Mechanical Design. And on the weekends I love to Wakeboard and play the Cello!
- I’m currently learning as much as I can. I am currently studying at Queen's University studying Engineering Physics and Computing.
- I’m looking to collaborate with companies and people that are working on projects that will help the world one idea at a time.
- How to reach me, by email nathan.pacey@magna.com.

- I would like to continue to work in the engineering field and create a design that matters. So if you are interested in talking to someone about the latest physics or are looking for an employee let me know!
