# 👋 Hey, I’m Nathan Pacey  

## 🧠 What I’m Into  

Quantum theory → quantum computing → actually solving real-world problems.  

I’m curious about everything from **finance, cosmology, and AI/ML** to **application development** — basically, if it’s an *(NP)* hard problem, I’m interested.  

I like **practical, multi-disciplinary problem solving** — physics, computing, math, whatever gets the job done.  


## 🔬 What I’m Working On  

- Researching **surface codes** and **stochastic noise** at **EPFL / CERN**  
- Exploring **quantum + optomechanical systems** at **IQC, University of Waterloo**  

**TL;DR:** trying to make quantum computers slightly less chaotic, one error model at a time.  



## 🎯 Goal  

Build a real working quantum computer… or at least solve the problems stopping us from doing so — on paper :|  

If I can make a real impact on quantum computing, I’ll consider the years of glorified linear algebra well spent.  



## 🛠️ Background  

Recovering **Engineering Physicist** and former **Roboticist** — so yes, I still like to build things in the real world too.  



## 🌲 Outside of Research  

I ski, hike, and travel to remind myself there’s a world beyond Dirac notation.
