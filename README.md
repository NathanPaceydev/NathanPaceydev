Hi I am Nathan Pacey.
- I’m interested in Theoretical Physics, Computing, Mathematics, Robotics and Mechanical Design. And on the weekends I love to Wakeboard and play the Cello!
- I’m currently learning as much as I can. I recently graduated from Queen's University where I studied Engineering Physics and Computing. Now I am pursuing a Master's Degree at EPFL in Quantum Science and Engineering. 
- I’m looking to collaborate with companies and people that are working on projects that will help the world one idea at a time.
- How to reach me, by email npacey01@gmail.com.

- I would like to continue to work in the engineering field and create a design that matters. So if you are interested in talking to someone about the latest physics or are looking for an employee let me know!
